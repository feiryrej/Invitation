      Dear Chute,
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The day our paths intertwined remains etched in my memory, and I am endlessly grateful that fate led us to each other, especially as your birthday approaches. You often remind me that everything happens for a reason, and perhaps our purpose is yet to unfold fully. I firmly believe that I was destined to enter your life as a gift from the universe, especially on your birthday. You are the beat of my heart, the essence of my soul, and the reason for my every smile. I can never thank you enough for being the extraordinary person that you are.
    </p>
    <br>

      Among all the days we've shared, mornings with you hold a special place in my heart. Waking up next to you, reveling in those precious moments together, and indulging in delightful TikTok videos as the morning sun bathes us in warmthâ€”I cherish these memories dearly. They serve as a source of solace during the challenging times we find ourselves in now. Whenever I feel the ache of our temporary separation, I find solace in closing my eyes and envisioning waking up to the gentle melody of your breathing, and suddenly, my world is alight with joy once more.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Distance has proven to be the greatest trial our relationship has faced, yet I firmly believe it is an opportunity for us to emerge stronger and more resilient. However, the awareness of the miles stretching between us, and the ticking of hours, weighs heavily on my heart. Some days are undeniably more challenging than others. You are intricately woven into the fabric of all my cherished moments. Every melody I hear carries the echo of your voice, introducing me to songs that resonate deep within my soul. Every adventure I embark upon leaves me yearning for your hand to hold. Every shared recollection with friends inevitably leads back to you. All my treasured memories bear the imprint of your love and laughter, serving as a testament to the profound impact you've had on my life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As you approach this special day, may the radiance of your smile illuminate every moment, and may the warmth of my love envelop you, even from afar. Happy Birthday, my love.  Please join me for a celebration this Sunday. I would be honored to share a delightful cake with you and commemorate your special day in the most memorable way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all my affection, Riri.
    </p>
